Anyone who lives within their means lacks imagination 
Everything is about sex except Sex which is about power
The books that the world calls immoral are the books that show the world it's own shame
The truth is rarely pure and never simple
I am so clever that sometimes I don't understand a single word of what I am saying
Public has curisoty of knowing everthing, except what is worth knowing
