"Self-absorption in all its forms kills empathy, let alone compassion. When we focus on ourselves, our world contracts as our problems and preoccupations loom large. But when we focus on others, our world expands. Our own problems drift to the periphery of the mind and so seem smaller, and we increase our capacity for connection - or compassionate action." ~ Daniel Goleman
"People learn what they want to learn. If learning is forced on us, even if we master it temporarily, it is soon forgotten." ~ Daniel Goleman
"In a very real sense we have two minds, one that thinks and one that feels" ~ Daniel Goleman
"Attention is a little-noticed and underrated mental asset." ~ Daniel Goleman
"The more socially intelligent you are, the happier and more robust and more enjoyable your relationships will be." ~ Daniel Goleman
