Neurosis is the inability to tolerate ambiguity
Men are strong so long as they represent a strong idea, they become powerless when they oppose it
Instinct of love toward an object demands a mastery to obtain it, and if a person feels they can't control the object or feel threatened by it, they act negatively toward it
No neurotic habors thoughts of sucide which are not murderous impulses against others redirected upon himself
