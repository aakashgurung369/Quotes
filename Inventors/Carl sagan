"If we can't think for ourselves, if we're unwilling to question authority, then we're just putty in the hands of those in power. But if the citizens are educated and form their own opinions, then those in power work for us.

In the demon-haunted world that we inhabit by virtue of being human, this may be all that stands between us and the enveloping darkness." ~ Carl Sagan
"Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality." ~ Carl Sagan
"You have to know the past to understand the present." ~ Carl Sagan
