We're least aware of what our minds do best. We're more aware of simple processes that don't work well - Marvin minsky
"You don't understand anything until you learn it more than one way." ~ Marvin Minsky
"If you understand something in only one way, then you don't really understand it at all. The secret of what anything means to us depends on how we've connected it to all other things we know. Well-connected representations let you turn ideas around in your mind, to envision things from many perspectives until you find one that works for you. And that's what we mean by thinking!" ~ Marvin Minsky
"No computer has ever been designed that is ever aware of what it's doing; but most of the time, we aren't either." ~ Marvin Minsky
"Once the computers got control, we might never get it back. We would survive at their sufferance. If we're lucky, they might decide to keep us as pets." ~ Marvin Minsky
"One can acquire certainty only by amputating inquiry." ~ Marvin Minsky
"Will robots inherit the earth? Yes, but they will be our children." ~ Marvin Minsky
"But the big feature of human-level intelligence is not what it does when it is works but what it does when it's stuck." ~ Marvin Minsky
"What is intelligence, anyway It is only a word that people use to name those unknown processes with which our brains solve problems we call hard. But whenever you learn a skill yourself, you're less impressed or mystified when other people do the same. This is why the meaning of 'intelligence' seems so elusive: It describes not some definite thing but only the momentary horizon of our ignorance about how minds might work." ~ Marvin Minsky
"You don't understand anything unless you understand there are at least 3 ways." ~ Marvin Minsky
"What magical trick makes us intelligent? The trick is that there is no trick. The power of intelligence stems from our vast diversity, not from any single, perfect principle." ~ Marvin Minsky
