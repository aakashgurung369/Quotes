"Bank robbery is an initiative of amateurs. True professionals establish a bank." ~ Bertolt Brecht
"In the dark times Will there also be singing? Yes, there will also be singing. About the dark times." ~ Bertolt Brecht
"Nowadays, anyone who wishes to combat lies and ignorance and to write the truth must overcome at least five difficulties. He must have the courage to write the truth when truth is everywhere opposed; the keenness to recognize it, although it is everywhere concealed; the skill to manipulate it as a weapon; the judgment to select those in whose hands it will be effective; and the running to spread the truth among such persons." ~ Bertolt Brecht
"Writers can't write as fast as governments make wars; because to write demands thinking." ~ Bertolt Brecht
