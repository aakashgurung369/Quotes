"Be happy for no reason, like a child. If you are happy for a reason, youâ€™re in trouble, because that reason can be taken from you." ~ Deepak Chopra
"You are not creating a new you; you are releasing a hidden you. The process is one of self discovery. The hidden you that wants to emerge is in perfect balance." ~ Deepak Chopra
