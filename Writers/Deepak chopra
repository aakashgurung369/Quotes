"Every thought, feeling, and emotion creates a molecule known as a neuropeptide. Neuropeptides travel throughout your body and hook onto receptor sites of cells and neurons. Your brain takes in the information, converts it into chemicals, and lets your whole body know if there's trouble in the world or cause for celebration. Your body is directly influenced as these molecules course through the bloodstream, delivering the energetic effect of whatever your brain is thinking and feeling." ~ Deepak Chopra
"If you have your full attention in the moment, you will see only love." ~ Deepak Chopra

"The three things you can offer your children to change them: attention, appreciation and affection." ~ Deepak Chopra
