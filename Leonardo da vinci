Leonardo da vinci
1. The noblest pleasure is the joy of understanding
2. A painter should begin every canvas with a wash of black because all things in nature are dark except where exposed by the light
3. "average human â€œlooks without seeing, listens without hearing, touches without feeling, eats without tasting, moves without physical awareness, inhales without awareness of odour or fragrance, and talks without thinking." ~ Leonardo da Vinci
