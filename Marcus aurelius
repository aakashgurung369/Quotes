Marcus aurelius
Reject your sense of injury and the injury itself disappears
On the power of the mind: "You have power over your mind – not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."
On the value of life: "When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive – to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love."   
On the nature of reality: "Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth."
On the importance of self-control: "The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts."
On the inevitability of change: "The universe is change; our life is what our thoughts make it."
On the value of inner peace: "Nowhere can man find a quieter or more untroubled retreat than in his own soul."
On the importance of living in the present: "Do not act as if you were going to live ten thousand years. Death hangs over you. While you live, while it is in your power, be good."
Enter their minds and you'll find the judges you're so afraid of and how judiciously they judge themselves
you could die right now, let this fact guide the rest of your life
Life is short and all things are temporary, so enjoy it while you can and don't worry about what others think
You could be good today but instead you choose tomorrow
Do not disturb yourself by imagining your whole life at once
Be tolerant with others and strict with yourself
The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing.
 It's the truth. I am after and the truth never harmed anyone.
The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding one self in the ranks of the insane.
If it is not right do not do it if it is not true do not say it.
The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding one cells in the ranks of the insane.
The best revenge is not to be like your enemy
