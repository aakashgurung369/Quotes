Peter Singer is known for his extensive work in ethics and animal rights, and he has many thought-provoking quotes. While listing hundreds might be impractical here, I can provide a selection of notable quotes from him. If you're looking for more, I suggest checking his books and articles for a comprehensive collection. Here are some impactful quotes:
