If words come from the heart they will enter the heart
Yesterday I was clever so I tried to change the world, now I m wise and I tried to change myself
The art of knowing is knowing what to ignore
instead offighting the world, kill your ego
f everything around you seems dark, look again, you may be the light.
Maybe you are searching among the braanches, for what only appears in the roots
