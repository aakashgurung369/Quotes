There is something at the bottom of every new human thought, every thought of genius or even every earnest thought that prints itself on any brain, which can never be communicated to others. Even if one were to write volumes about it, and were to explain one idea for thirty-five years, there would always remain something left which could not be induced to emerge from your brain and would remain with you forever, and with it you will die without communicating it to anyone, having the most important of your ideas.
Man has such a predilection for systems and abstract deductions that he is ready to distort the truth intentionally, he is ready to deny the evidence of his senses only to justify his logic
I love mankind, he said "but I find to my amazement that the more I love mankind as a whole the less I love man in particular"
