"The truth may be stretched thin, but it never breaks, and it always surfaces above lies, as oil floats on water."
"To surrender dreams — this may be madness. Too much sanity may be madness — and maddest of all: to see life as it is, and not as it should be!"   
"Hunger is the best sauce in the world."
"Tell me thy company, and I'll tell thee what thou art."
"Reading is the foundation of all knowledge."
