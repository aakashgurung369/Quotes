"Perfection of rhythm, balanced perfection of rhythm. Everything in Nature is expressed by rhythmic waves of light. Every thought and action is a light-wave of thought and action. If one interprets the God within one, one's thoughts and actions must be balanced rhythmic waves. Ugliness, fears, failures and diseases arise from unbalanced thoughts and actions. Therefore think beauty always if one desire vitality of body and happiness." ~ Walter Russell
"Meditation transports one from the transient world of matter to the real world of dreamings, visions, and imaginings where idea is and concepts are born." ~ Walter Russell
