Freedom is not achieved by satisfying desire, but by eliminationg it
Never depend on the admiration of others. There is no strength in it or general merit cannot be deprived from an external source.
Every circumstance comes with two handles, which one of which you can hold it, while with the other conditions are insupportable
Don't just say that you have read books. Show that through them you have learned to think better
We are not disturbed by what happens to us, but by pur thoughts about what happens to us
