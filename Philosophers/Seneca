Everything jangs on one's thinking.. A man is unhappy as he has convinced himslef he is
No man is more unhappy than he who never faces adversity for he is not permitted to prove himself
Life without the courage for death is slavery
You act like mortals in all of your fears, and immortal in all of your desires
The whole future lies in uncertanity
The day a man becomes superior to pleasure, he will also be superior to pain
The important thing about a problem is not its solution, but the strength we gain in finding the solution
Time heals what reason cannot
