If the truth shall kill them, let them die
One who makes himself a worm cannot complain afterwards if people step on him.



Immanuel Kant was a seminal figure in modern philosophy, whose works touched on epistemology, ethics, metaphysics, and aesthetics. His writings, particularly in works like "Critique of Pure Reason," "Critique of Practical Reason," and "Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals," have influenced countless fields of thought.
