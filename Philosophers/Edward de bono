"Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way." ~ Edward de Bono

The essence of creativity is not to see things as they are, but as they might be.


                                  Problem-Solving
A good decision is one that is based on the facts available at the time
The world is full of people who have never learned to think.
The purpose of thinking is to get us out of the prison of our own minds.
You don't need to be a genius to think creatively. You need a method.

                 On Change and Innovation
Change is not always growth, but growth is always change.
Innovation is about seeing things in a new way, not simply creating something new.

"Most of the mistakes in thinking are inadequacies of perception rather than mistakes of logic." ~ Edward de Bono

                  On Thinking and Mindsets:
"A man who does not think for himself is like a machine."
"Thinking should not be restricted to a single direction. All directions are worth exploring."
"There are many ways of thinking, and it is only when you learn to use them all that you can think in a truly creative and effective way."

                  On the Mind and Perception:
"We see things as we are, not as they are."
"What we think we know is often the result of our training, not reality."
