A man can be himself only so long as he is alone, and if he does not love solitude, he will not love freedom, for it is only when he is alone that he is really free
A happy life is impossible, the est that a man can attain is a heroic life
Mostly it is loss which teaches us about the worth of things
Schopenhauer identified three basic motivations for human actions: egoism, malice, and compassion. He saw compassion as the only truly moral motivation.

"Pleasure is never as pleasant as we expected it to be and pain is always more painful. The pain in the world always outweighs the pleasure. If you don't believe it, compare the respective feelings of two animals, one of which is eating the other." ~ Arthur Schopenhauer
"Nature shows that with the growth of intelligence comes increased capacity for pain, and it is only with the highest degree of intelligence that suffering reaches its supreme point." ~ Arthur Schopenhauer
"There is in the world only the choice between loneliness and vulgarity. All young people should be taught now to put up with loneliness ... because the less man is compelled to come into contact with others, the better off he is." ~ Arthur Schopenhauer
