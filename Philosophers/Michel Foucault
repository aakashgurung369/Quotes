"Search for what is good and strong and beautiful in your society and elaborate from there. Push outward. Always create from what you already have. Then you will know what to do." ~ Michel Foucault
"Freedom of conscience entails more dangers than authority and despotism." ~ Michel Foucault
"To change something in the minds of people - that's the role of an intellectual." ~ Michel Foucault
"Knowledge is not made for understanding; it is made for cutting." ~ Michel Foucault
"I don't write a book so that it will be the final word; I write a book so that other books are possible, not necessarily written by me." ~ Michel Foucault
"There are more ideas on earth than intellectuals imagine. And these ideas are more active, stronger, more resistant, more passionate than "politicians" think. We have to be there at the birth of ideas, the bursting outward of their force: not in books expressing them, but in events manifesting this force, in struggles carried on around ideas, for or against them. Ideas do not rule the world. But it is because the world has ideas (and because it constantly produces them) that it is not passively ruled by those who are its leaders or those who would like to teach it, once and for all, what it must think." ~ Michel Foucault
