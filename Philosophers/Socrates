The beginning of wisdom is the definition of terms
By all means marry if you get a good wife, you will become happy if you get a bad one you will become a philosopher.
Do not grieve over someone who changes all of the sudden. It might be that he has given up acting and returned to his true self
Understanding a question is half an answer
Wonder is the feeling of philosopher & philosophy begins in wonder

"The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing."
"An unexamined life is not worth living."
"To know oneself is to know one's limits."
"Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle."
"The greatest way to live with honor in this world is to be what we pretend to be."
"Strong minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, weak minds discuss people."   
"Education is the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel."   
"The only good is knowledge and the only evil is ignorance."   
"I know that I am intelligent, because I know that I know nothing."

"The greatest good is to discuss virtue every day."
"The wise man is always learning."
Contentment is natural wealth luxury is artificial poverty.
